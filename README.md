# Social Network API

In this project, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

This application accomplishes the following:

1. When `npm start` is entered in the command line, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
2. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for Users and Thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in formatted JSON.
3. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update and delete users and thoughts in my database.
4. When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user's friend list.
